## _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1_

Developed by [Melanie Archer](https://github.com/mejarc/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git).

A static webpage incrementally converted to a mobile-ready web application.

In **Stage One**, the enhancements include:
* conversion to responsive design
* screen reader accessibility features
* adding a service worker to cache content.

### Installation and usage
* [Clone or download the code repo](https://github.com/mejarc/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git)

* In a console or terminal, go to the folder on your local computer where you have placed the code, and type
```shell
npm install
```
and then
```shell
grunt
```
to complete installation.
* Now, start an HTTP server on your local computer. One method is to use a simple Python tool that you probably already have installed on your computer. Try the following:

    * In a console or terminal, check the version of Python you have: 
  ```shell
  python -V
  ```
    * If you have Python 2.x, start the server by typing this into the console window:
  ```shell
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
  ``` 
    * If you have Python 3.x, type:
  ```shell
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```
    * If you don't have Python installed, go to the Python [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
